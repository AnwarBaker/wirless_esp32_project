"# wirless_esp32_project" 
This project successfully demonstrates a wireless sensor alert system using four ESP32 devices communicating via the ESP-NOW protocol. Three of the ESP32s are individually connected to different sensor modules (Ultrasonic, IR, and LDR), each monitoring a specific environmental condition. When a sensor detects an event—such as motion, light intensity changes, or an object at a certain distance—it transmits a signal wirelessly to a central ESP32 unit.

The central ESP32 acts as a receiver and responds to each sensor's signal by lighting up a dedicated LED, offering immediate visual feedback. This modular and wireless setup minimizes wiring complexity and proves effective for real-time, multi-node sensor networks.

Through this project, key concepts such as ESP-NOW communication, MAC address
 filtering, and sensor data handling were practically implemented, making it a robust and scalable foundation for future IoT systems or smart monitoring solutions.
